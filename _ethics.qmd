## Data Science Ethics

### Privacy
In data science, the principle of privacy emphasizes safeguarding
individualsâ€™ personal information by ensuring it is collected, stored,
and used responsibly. It requires that data scientists practice
transparency about what data is being gathered and why, obtain
informed consent, and limit collection to only what is
necessary. Protecting privacy also involves securing data against
unauthorized access, applying methods like anonymization to reduce
risks of re-identification, and ensuring that information is not
repurposed beyond its intended use without permission. By upholding
privacy, data scientists respect individual autonomy, build trust, and
reduce the risk of harm or exploitation, making it a cornerstone of
ethical and responsible data practice.
